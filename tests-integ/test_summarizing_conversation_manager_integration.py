"""Integration tests for SummarizingConversationManager with actual AI models.

These tests validate the end-to-end functionality of the SummarizingConversationManager
by testing with real AI models and API calls. They ensure that:

1. **Real summarization** - Tests that actual model-generated summaries work correctly
2. **Context overflow handling** - Validates real context overflow scenarios and recovery
3. **Tool preservation** - Ensures ToolUse/ToolResult pairs survive real summarization
4. **Message structure** - Verifies real model outputs maintain proper message structure
5. **Agent integration** - Tests that conversation managers work with real Agent workflows

These tests require API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and make real API calls, so they should be run sparingly
and may be skipped in CI environments without proper credentials.

    # History of Computers

    The history of computers spans many centuries, evolving from simple calculating tools to 
    the powerful machines we use today.

    ## Early Computing Devices
    - **Ancient abacus** (3000 BCE): One of the earliest computing devices used for arithmetic calculations
    - **Pascaline** (1642): Mechanical calculator invented by Blaise Pascal
    - **Difference Engine** (1822): Designed by Charles Babbage to compute polynomial functions
    - **Analytical Engine**: Babbage's more ambitious design, considered the first general-purpose computer concept
    - **Hollerith's Tabulating Machine** (1890s): Used punch cards to process data for the US Census

    ## Early Electronic Computers
    - **ENIAC** (1945): First general-purpose electronic computer, weighed 30 tons
    - **EDVAC** (1949): Introduced the stored program concept
    - **UNIVAC I** (1951): First commercial computer in the United States

    # The First Computers

    Early computers were dramatically different from today's machines in almost every aspect:

    ## Physical Characteristics
    - **Enormous size**: Room-filling or even building-filling machines
    - **ENIAC** (1945) weighed about 30 tons, occupied 1,800 square feet
    - Consisted of large metal frames or cabinets filled with components
    - Required special cooling systems due to excessive heat generation

    ## Technology and Components
    - **Vacuum tubes**: Thousands of fragile glass tubes served as switches and amplifiers
    - ENIAC contained over 17,000 vacuum tubes
    - Generated tremendous heat and frequently failed
    - **Memory**: Limited storage using delay lines, cathode ray tubes, or magnetic drums
