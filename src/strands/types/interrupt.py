"""Interrupt related type definitions for human-in-the-loop workflows.

Interrupt Flow:
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        A[Invoke Agent] --> B[Execute Hook/Tool]
        B --> C{Interrupts Raised?}
        C -->|No| D[Continue Agent Loop]
        C -->|Yes| E[Stop Agent Loop]
        E --> F[Return Interrupts]
        F --> G[Respond to Interrupts]
        G --> H[Execute Hook/Tool with Responses]
        H --> I{New Interrupts?}
        I -->|Yes| E
        I -->|No| D
    ```

Example:
    ```Python
    from typing import Any

    from strands import Agent, tool
    from strands.hooks import BeforeToolCallEvent, HookProvider, HookRegistry


    @tool
    def delete_tool(key: str) -> bool:
        print("DELETE_TOOL | deleting")
        return True


    class ToolInterruptHook(HookProvider):
        def register_hooks(self, registry: HookRegistry, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
            registry.add_callback(BeforeToolCallEvent, self.approve)

        def approve(self, event: BeforeToolCallEvent) -> None:
            if event.tool_use["name"] != "delete_tool":
                return

            approval = event.interrupt("for_delete_tool", reason="APPROVAL")
            if approval != "A":
                event.cancel_tool = "approval was not granted"

    agent = Agent(
        hooks=[ToolInterruptHook()],
        tools=[delete_tool],
        system_prompt="You delete objects given their keys.",
        callback_handler=None,
    )
    result = agent(f"delete object with key 'X'")

    if result.stop_reason == "interrupt":
        responses = []
        for interrupt in result.interrupts:
            if interrupt.name == "for_delete_tool":
                responses.append({"interruptResponse": {"interruptId": interrupt.id, "response": "A"})

        result = agent(responses)

    ...
    ```

Details:
    - User raises interrupt on their hook event by calling `event.interrupt()`.
    - User can raise one interrupt per hook callback.
    - Interrupts stop the agent event loop.
    - Interrupts are returned to the user in AgentResult.
    - User resumes by invoking agent with interrupt responses.
    - Second call to `event.interrupt()` returns user response.
    - Process repeats if user raises additional interrupts.
    - Interrupts are session managed in-between return and user response.
