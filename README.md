This repository contains the documentation for the Strands Agents SDK, a simple yet powerful framework for building and running AI agents. The documentation is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme and provides guides, examples, and API references.

The official documentation is available online at: https://strandsagents.com.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 20+, npm

### Setup and Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Building and Previewing

Generate the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run a local development server at http://localhost:4321/:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Writing Documentation

Documentation lives in `docs/` as Markdown files. The site structure is driven by `src/config/navigation.yml` (navigation) and rendered by Astro at build time.

- Pages are written in standard Markdown — no Astro-specific syntax needed for content edits
- Use `<Tabs>` / `<Tab label="...">` for language-switching code blocks (auto-imported, no import needed)
- Use `--8<-- "path/to/file.ts:snippet_name"` to include code snippets from external files
- Link to other pages using relative file paths (e.g. `../tools/index.md`) — they resolve automatically
- Link to API reference pages using the `@api` shorthand: `[@api/python/strands.agent.agent](#AgentResult)`

For a full reference on customizations, components, and the migration status, see [Site Architecture](SITE-ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Using the `docs-` skills

The repo ships four agent skills that cover the documentation workflow: `docs-planner`, `docs-audit`, `docs-writer`, and `docs-reviewer`. They live under `.agents/skills/` (with symlinks at `.claude/skills/` and `.kiro/skills/`). See [`site/AGENTS.md`](site/AGENTS.md#documentation-skills-and-voice-references) for triggers and scopes.

Use them piecemeal when you already know the scope:

- `/docs-audit <page>` to assess a published page before rewriting.
- `/docs-writer <page or topic>` to draft a new page or rewrite an existing one. Step 7 of the skill runs `docs-reviewer` automatically.
- `/docs-reviewer <draft>` on its own when you want a voice/style sign-off without a rewrite.
- `/docs-planner` to prioritize the backlog when you don't yet know what to touch.

Or chain them with a `/goal` directive to drive a full update from a single SDK change. `/goal` is a usage convention, not a built-in command: you set the target and the workflow, the skills do the work. For example:

```
/goal https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-typescript/commit/<sha>

1. /docs-planner: pick the top item touched by this commit.
2. /docs-audit: find issues on that page.
3. /docs-writer: fix them.
4. /docs-reviewer: sign off, or send back. Default to step 3 for voice/style/code
   fixes; bounce to step 2 (or step 1) if the finding is structural. Cap retries at
   3, then escalate.

The goal is complete when docs-reviewer returns a "Ship it" verdict and the
resulting commit is on a branch ready for PR.
```

This pattern is useful when the change is narrow (one feature, one or two pages) and you want the skills to handle planner → audit → write → review without you re-prompting at every step.

> These skills are a work in progress. If outputs are wrong, insufficient, or unexpected, contribute updates to `.agents/`.
