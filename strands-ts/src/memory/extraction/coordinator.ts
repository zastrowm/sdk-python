/**
 * Saves conversation messages to memory stores, in the background, without slowing the agent down.
 *
 * How it works, in three pieces:
 *
 * 1. **The buffer.** Every message the agent produces is copied into one shared list (`_pending`).
 *    Each gets a number (`seq`) that only ever counts up, so we can tell which messages are newer.
 *    We keep our own copy here (rather than reading the agent's live message list) because the agent
 *    can delete old messages to stay within its context window; our copy means we never lose one
 *    before it's saved.
 *
 * 2. **Per-store progress.** Each store can save at its own pace, so we remember, per store, the
 *    `seq` of the last message it has already saved (`_marks`). When a store saves, it only looks at
 *    messages newer than that number, so the same message is never saved twice to the same store.
 *
 * 3. **One save at a time per store.** A store might be asked to save again while a previous save is
 *    still running. We chain each store's saves one after another (`_chains`) so they can't overlap
 *    or run out of order.
 *
 * If a store fails to save {@link SAVE_FAILURES_BEFORE_BACKOFF} times in a row, it backs off: instead
 * of trying every turn, it retries only once every {@link BACKOFF_PROBE_INTERVAL} attempts (a probe).
 * A successful probe clears the failure streak and resumes normal saving - so a transient outage
 * recovers on its own and the messages buffered during it are saved once the store comes back. A
 * permanently broken store keeps probing and logs an error each time, surfacing the misconfiguration.
 *
 * Saving itself either runs the store's extractor to pull out facts, or hands the raw messages to the
 * store - see {@link _write}.
 * @internal
